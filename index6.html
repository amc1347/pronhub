          <h2>Letter from the editor</h2>
          <p>Hello and welcome to the world of ethical porn.</p>
          <p>I just want to start off by saying there is nothing wrong with pornography or masturbating. Both are extremely healthy and completely normal. However, the porn industry, which started out with Hugh Hefner and his magazine. Before, the thought of porn was taboo and usually had something to do with perversion. Once the magazine became published, many women saw that as a way to free their body and many heterosexual men reaped benefits out this magazine. </p>
          <p>After a few decades, the freedom of a woman’s body became abused by the porn industry and male desire. Instead of empowering acts, it became a horrible HR department nightmare (especially because...well, their jobs revolved entirely around nudity and sex). Many of the women who were involved in the industry became sexually, physically, and verbally abused because of the lack of consent and need for money. </p>
          <p>It is the start of the new decade and the amount of “teen”, “step-sister”, “abuse”, “torture”, “rough”, and “punishment” started to increase in circulation for these videos. Although many of these videos were made in completely safe environments, there are still a good chunk that are not. A lot of the porn stars that work under a company of brand often are the ones that are getting abused. </p>
          <p>I’m not calling out all of these companies and telling you to stop watching them. I’m simply saying next time you click on a porn video on pornhub, do you think both actors are consenting to everything done in the video? </p>
          <p>A lot of female porn stars, who once felt unsafe, have been able to make it work so that they are comfortable in the environment they make money now. This usually involves webcamming or starting their own channel on sites like Pornhub or even starting their own blog (just like sugarcookie.com). These are all really good examples of how porn can be ethical and consenting. </p>
          <p>My hope is that one day we could have a mutually beneficial relationship between the producers and the consumers in the porn industry. </p>
